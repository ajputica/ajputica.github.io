      <p>I am a currently a student-athlete at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am a freshman on the Women's Basketball team. </p>
	The major I am pursuing is Software Engineering. My dad is a software engineer at 
	     <a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle</a>
		     . He works at the Broomfield Campus in Colorado. I hope to be as successful as he is in this field. I am fairly new to everything related to this major. However, I plan on learning and understanding so much more.  I am currently taking Intro to Computer Science as my first class in this field of study. So far I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I hope to learn javascript, and more about computer science as well as programming.</p>
