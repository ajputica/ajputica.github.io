  <h2 class="me">About Me</h2>
    
   <p id="life">I was born in Broomfield, Colorado on July 19, 2000. I have two sisters, one younger and one older. Rachel is the oldest by one year. She currently attends University of Colorado-Boulder. My youngest sister is Sarah, and she is just 6 years old. I am currently a student-athlete at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am a freshman on the Women's Basketball team. The major I am pursuing is Software Engineering. My dad is a software engineer at Oracle. He works at the Broomfield Campus in Colorado. I hope to be as successful as he is in this field. I am fairly new to everything related to this major. However, I plan on learning and understanding so much more. I am currently taking Intro to Computer Science as my first class in this field of study. So far I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I hope to learn javascript, and more about computer science as well as programming.

       Over time, I have also gradually increased my coding skils. I have started to code both websites, such as this website, and have created small projects on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/244449570/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> and I am currently starting my education at FGCU as a Computer Information Systems major. I am currently taking <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/prof-v/lms/cop-1500" target="_blank">Intro to Computer Science</a> and rapidly learning how to code with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/thechadinator" target="_blank"> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a> I have also written a <a href="Fields%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">Field's Report,</a> defining the difference in fields of computer science.<!--The below text creates an image with a link-->

  <h3 class="me">Achievements and Goals</h3>
      
    <p id="life">
      When I was in High School, I was in the Cambridge program and in the Advanced Placement program. I came into college with over 30 college credits, and high SAT and ACT scores. These high scores enabled me to get scholarships from FGCU, such as the <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/admissionsandaid/undergraduateadmissions/scholarshipsandwaivers.aspx" target="_blank">FGCU President's Gold Scholarship</a> and Bright Futures from the state. Some of my goals for the future include becoming an RA for South Village, becoming a teaching assistant for a computer science class, completing my 80 required service hours early, and staying on top of my homework.
